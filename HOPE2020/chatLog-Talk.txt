did that top cell change from Code to Raw NBConvert by accident?
i do it by keyboard shortcut by accident
im not sure what it is

it's markdown formatted instead of code formatted

I'm not into the subject matter, but years ago Sebastian Thrun's class on Udacity was good
psenough
it feels like it's moving so fast that anything 3 years ago is outdatted. i heard a lot of good things about just getting into tensorflow and go from there

if you're ok with python you could try messing around with the sklearn tutorials

i think edx has some courses on ML as well. was thinking about checking them out at some point so not sure how good they are

I hear face masks are a good alternative to sunglasses.

What about putting patterns on a mask/face covering?
notthomzane
Face masks + sunglasses are even better.
psenough
the sunglasses approach feels kinda more elegant :D

Seems like after the area surrounding the eyes, the next best would be cheekbones & jawline, at least if you want to be so targeted as to select what face you should appear as.

SKLearn example?
ariella
how do we get those glasses or face mask with those images??
buddhabrot
Something I'm wondering is how much evidence is there that an adversarial attack against one trained model will work against a totally different model? 

Like, I could imagine that the sunglasses would work great on the model the researchers trained, but there might be other models out there that handle the sunglasses more easily. 
greylight
Do you know of any tools that are, or could be easily integrated into a mobile app for poisoning images?

How quantified is the resilience of machine learning models?

Their youtube channel has excellent demos

ML is pretty obviously not generalized AI, at least to me, how do you see your research going towards that or do you even care about generalized AI?
